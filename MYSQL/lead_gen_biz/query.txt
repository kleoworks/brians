GROUP BY clients.client_id, sites.domain_name
ORDER BY clients.last_name, sites.domain_name;


8b.  Come up with a second query that shows all the clients, the site name(s), and the total number of leads generated from each site for all time.

USE lead_gen_business;
SELECT clients.first_name, clients.last_name, sites.domain_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS num_leads
FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
LEFT JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
GROUP BY clients.client_id, sites.domain_name
ORDER BY clients.last_name, sites.domain_name;


9.  Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client each month of the year.

USE lead_gen_business;
SELECT clients.first_name, clients.last_name, DATE_FORMAT(billing.charged_datetime, '%Y') AS billing_year, DATE_FORMAT(billing.charged_datetime, '%m') AS billing_month, SUM(billing.amount) AS billing_amt
FROM clients
JOIN billing ON clients.client_id = billing.client_id
GROUP BY clients.client_id, DATE_FORMAT(billing.charged_datetime, '%Y'), DATE_FORMAT(billing.charged_datetime, '%m')
ORDER BY clients.last_name, DATE_FORMAT(billing.charged_datetime, '%Y') DESC, DATE_FORMAT(billing.charged_datetime, '%m') DESC;


10.  Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns. Group the results so that each row shows a new client. Add a new field called 'sites' that has all the sites that the client owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)

USE lead_gen_business;
SELECT clients.client_id, clients.first_name, clients.last_name, clients.email, GROUP_CONCAT(sites.domain_name) AS domains
FROM clients
JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
GROUP BY clients.client_id
ORDER BY clients.client_id;
